# Stock Market Closing price Predictor

## This prediction model which uses Machine Learning to predict the closing price of CFDs based on previous data which is being fed into the model Which is helping it to try and predict as accurate as possible.

# PREREQUISITS

* You will need to have to have python 3.6 or greater to use it (if not Linux, Windows and Mac users [HERE](https://www.tutsmake.com/install-python-on-windows-linux-mac/) check this out.
* You will need to have installed tensor flow (but I recommend you use Google colab if you don't have enough ram and tensor is a high demanding module).

## Back story
I was very boared but was facinated by machine learning and the Markets (was also trying to learn how the markets would fair the next coming day(s)). So I decided to learn more about how I could use machine learning to predict the outcomes of the stock market.

## UP NEXT 
I will be creating a GUI for this project so that anyone can use it without running it in a notebook and this will be on my website, for now Calmate, se hara pronto
